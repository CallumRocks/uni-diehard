#Critical Reflection of Die Hard Marketing Website 

This is a university project built using Bootstrap.

This article is a Critical Reflection on the promotional site for Die Hard seen here Die Hard Website.

Fabulous Films wants a website that promotes their new film Die Hard and suits all of their needs.

From the beginning design and development was left up to the developer as the company at the time had “no clear ideas” as to what they wanted the site to look like. Design prototypes where made as an accurate representation of the site to get the clients go ahead prior to beginning development.

Ideas where discussed and mockups presented and an agreement was made that the mockups should be carried on through to development with some minor changes to be considered.

#Evaluation
These changes included cutting the cluttered and busy look of the site e.g. background images contrasting with foreground elements. Revealing too much information via the site that may be considered spoilers before seeing the movie. Discussing future films which are yet to be announced.

All of these changes where taken into consideration and have been handled as follows; there is much less eye stimulation to the point where you don’t know where to look, written content such as character backgrounds have been copyrighted carefully to assure no spoilers are given. The section where future films where featured has been entirely removed.

Other changes made; the original trailer section features a video slider with four video trailers. This was removed as four trailers is too much, it gives away more than enough detail to allow a potential viewer to say “I’ve seen enough to know what happens next” and not view the movie. Instead one trailer (the original) was chosen, this is intrigues potential viewers long enough that they want to buy a ticket.

The site is built as a one-page scroll based navigation, with some parallax effects; this is ultimately for the most modern look and appealing layout to a user’s eyes. To boost fluidity in the site transition effects are used on many elements to enhance interaction. Another reason for this is that the simple linear experience is a much more immersive enviroment. A study by 37signals shows that these single page websites have a much greater chance (37.5%) of a user signing up or purchasing a product. The site is also more mobile and tablet friendly this way as scrolling is an natural and easy interaction on a touch screen device

The normal purpose of a one-page site is to get to the point and has one purpose e.g. to sell or promote a single product. Which is what this site does. To sell the movie Die Hard.

The booking form was changed to be more interactive and fun. In the original it is a simple seat picker and contact form. The newer version features a pure CSS styled cinema ticket with drop down boxes to select your local cinema, times, dates and amount of tickets you want.

The site is responsive, thanks to Bootstrap and many media queries which where used to maximize multi platform usability. Bootstraps columns and grid layout where of great help when building each element and section of the site to support the most comfortable and responsive user interface. Media queries where used for many individual elements such as font sizes, widths, margins and padding sizes when the site was collapsed into a much smaller viewport. Bootstrap was also used because of its cross browser compatibilty ensuring a quicker development process; it was also used as the community is very helpful so that if there where any major problems thoughout development their would always be people who know how to fix it or guide development.

Separating content in the site with only a header as a key feature of a new section was not clear enough and so using JavaScript and CSS a top and bottom feature was created to allow the user to click an icon to take them to the top of the site (Home) or to the bottom (Booking Ticket Section), this is situated between every section which does not already have a defining separation such as a background image. These icons where also key in creating more navigation helping create a greater user experience.

Things that could have been done differently; If given more time, the first thing would be to make the gallery more interactive. Currently the site features a responsive gallery with images large enough that they do not require a click feature, but if the opportunity arose to take on a project like this again a more interactive gallery would be built and time would be better managed to assure that it could be done in the alotted time. Another item to consider is to better the booking form to build the entire form into the ticket instead of sepearting it into two.

Throughout development I took advantage of animate.css by Daniel Eden for extra animations throughout my site. I also used font-awesome in my site for icons like the ticket, home, heart and thumbs down icons throughout the site.

#Testing
Browser Testing In the three main browsers; Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari
W3C Validation for debugging, future-proof quality checking, assures quality code
User Testing to make sure that it is not just my opinion influencing the site
External Testing from sites like nibbler.com
Cross Browser testing was carried out between all three major browsers, Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox. The three browsers where also tested on a mobile platform (iPhone 6s Plus). The site functions well on all browsers on desktop, tablet and mobile.

The site fully validates with W3C Validator. Results from W3C Validator can be seen here or can be tested at W3C Validator using the url http//:diehard.callumrocks.uk

The site was tested with three users to assure that the site was meeting the standards and expectations of everyday users. In conclusion the results showed that the site functioned well and was pleasing and easy to use for each user. One user did mention problem with legibility on the slider text due to the thickness of the black outline, this issue has been resolved and the text styling edited for greater legibility. 
"The layout of the website is orderly, with each section clearly headed which enables visitors to easily scroll through the site and find what they are looking for. Also, with the addition of a tab function, visitors are able to select a section from a table which reduces the amount of time it takes to find what they are looking for. There is also a button that appears upon reaching the end of the page which, when operated, returns the visitor to the top of the page, saving them the hassle of doing it manually. The website features various headings appropriate to the Die Hard film, such as a prompt and precise description of the movie, details of characters and the main setting, trailers, reviews, and a completely functional form that allows visitors to book tickets to see the film at a local cinema. Overall, the website is simple to navigate and can be grasped by anyone visiting the page, and is an ideal site in garnering an interest in the Die Hard film due to the featured content which I believe would create an impression on movie goers if Die Hard was released today."-Steven Angus (one of the testers)
